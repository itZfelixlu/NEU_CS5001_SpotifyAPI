Project Option2: Personalized Music Recommendation System Using
Spotify API

Project Overview:
Students will create a personalized music recommendation system using the Spotify Web
API. The system will allow users to search for songs, artists, or albums and get
recommendations based on their favorite tracks, artists, or genres. They can also view top
charts and get recommendations based on Spotify's music analysis features (e.g., tempo,
danceability, energy).

Key Features:
1. Search for Songs, Artists, or Albums:
○ Allow users to search for their favorite songs, artists, or albums and get detailed
information like genre, popularity, and top tracks.

2. Personalized Song Recommendations:
○ Recommend songs based on the user’s favorite tracks, artists, or genres.
○ Use Spotify’s song attributes like tempo, energy, and mood to give tailored
recommendations.

3. Top Charts:
○ Display top songs or albums from a specific country or globally, based on
Spotify's charts.

4. User Input and Preferences:
○ Allow users to "like" songs and receive recommendations based on their input.
○ Create a playlist of recommended songs that the user can review and save.

5. Data Source:
○ Use the Spotify Web API to fetch real-time music data, such as artist information,
track details, and personalized recommendations.

6. Error Handling:
○ Handle invalid user inputs, such as searching for songs that don't exist or
incorrect artist names, and gracefully guide the user.

Steps to Build:
1. Set Up Spotify API:
○ Sign up for a Spotify developer account and get API credentials.
○ Use Python libraries like Spotipy or requests to interact with the Spotify API.

2. Search for Songs/Artists/Albums:
○ Build functions to allow users to search for songs, artists, or albums and get
detailed information. For example, a user could type in "Taylor Swift," and the
program would return her top songs and albums.

3. Personalized Recommendations:
○ Using Spotify’s recommendations feature, recommend tracks based on user
preferences (e.g., favorite genre or artist).
○ Use track features like tempo, danceability, energy, and valence to give
personalized song recommendations.

4. Build the Interface:
○ Allow users to input their favorite songs or genres and return a list of song
recommendations.
